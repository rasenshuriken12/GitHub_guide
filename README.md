# Hosting a website on GitHub using GitHub Pages:

```html
• Create a New Repository: 
	• Navigate to your GitHub dashboard and click the "New" button to create a new repository. 
	• For a personal or organization site: Name the repository exactly your-username.github.io (replace your-username with your actual GitHub username) or your-organization.github.io. 
	• For a project site: Name the repository after your project (e.g., my-project). 
	• Ensure the repository is set to Public. 
```

```html
• Upload Your Website Files: 
	• Clone the repository to your local machine using Git, or upload files directly through the GitHub web interface. 
	• Place all your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) in the root directory of this repository. 
	• Ensure there is an index.html file, as this will be the default landing page. 

• Commit and Push Changes: 
	• If using Git locally, commit your changes and push them to the GitHub repository. 
	• If uploading via the web interface, commit the changes after uploading the files. 
```

```html
• Configure GitHub Pages: 
	• Navigate to your repository on GitHub and click on the Settings tab. 
	• In the left sidebar, click on Pages. 
	• Under "Build and deployment," ensure the "Source" is set to "Deploy from a branch." 
	• Under "Branch," select the branch containing your website files (typically main or master) and choose the root directory (/). 
	• Click Save. 
```

```html
• Access Your Website: 
	- GitHub Pages will now build and deploy your website. This process may take a few minutes. 
	- Once deployed, the URL for your website will be displayed in the "Pages" section of your repository settings. 
	- For a personal or organization site, the URL will be your-username.github.io. 
	- For a project site, the URL will be your-username.github.io/repository-name. 
```

Your website is now live and accessible via the provided URL. You can also configure a custom domain if desired within the GitHub Pages settings.
